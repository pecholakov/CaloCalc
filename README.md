CaloCalc
========

Overview 
-------

CaloCalc calculates the recommended daily caloric intakes for every user and how many of those calories should be from proteins, fats and carbohydrates. It calculates the recommended daily caloric intakes based on information given for user's body and using the Harrisâ€“Benedict equations (revised by Roza and Shizgal). CaloCalc also stores statistics for every user. 
In a database are stored foods, quantity for each food, calories and chemical composition (fats, carbohydrates and proteins). Every user can add or modify records in this database.
